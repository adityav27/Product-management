# Product-management
I recently participated in a Product Management Hackathon organized by IIT Guwahati, collaborating with two friends. As the Product Manager, I led the development of a comprehensive roadmap to integrate street vendors with Zomato, prioritizing both vendor and consumer needs.

Our team designed an innovative solution, complete with implementation strategies, to bridge the gap between street vendors and Zomato's platform. My friends expertly crafted a visually appealing PDF presentation, effectively communicating our vision.

This hackathon experience not only honed my product management skills but also demonstrated the potential for technology to empower marginalized communities, such as street vendors.
